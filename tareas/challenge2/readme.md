How to run the script?

1) Download the git repository from my github account: 
https://github.com/guillermortiz21/mcd-programacion2 if for some reason you donâ€™t have permissions to see the repository or to download it, send me an email to guillermo.ortiz7875@alumnos.udg.mx

2) With the repository downloaded you can navigate to the folder tareas/challenge2 here you will find a python script called challenge2_GuillermoOrtiz.py in this script contains all the logic about how to download, instantiate and run the BERT NLP model, and the implementation to use it with the glassdoor reviews dataset.

3) Download the dataset glassdoor_reviews.csv from glassdoor: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidgauthier/glassdoor-job-reviews and add the csv in the same folder as the challenge2_GuillermoOrtiz.py file.

5) With all dependencies downloaded you can simply run the script with the command  python challenge2_GuillermoOrtiz.py you will see the process of the script in the logs:
